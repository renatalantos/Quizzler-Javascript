[Confidentiality statement](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/Confidentiality_statement.JPG)


# Features

## Header

The header contains a logo of the Support group, links to the Home, About, Sessions, Gallery and Contact pages.
The header will allow the user to see all available pages at a glance and navigate between pages without having to go back to the previous pages. The header is present on all pages linked in it, except for the Confidentiality page, which is a document, not an actual webpage.


## Footer 

The footer contains a link to the Condidentiality page (statement), a link to contact a child psychologist and links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube pages. For visual enhancement, it displays icons over the link text. For a simpler solution, the <em>Follow us on social media</em> text is not a link, user needs to click on the icons. Hovering over them guide the user. On the <em>Confidentiality</em> and <em>Contact a child psychologist</em> links the actual text is clickable, the icons are unresponsive. Users can use the <em>Contact a child psychologist</em> link as a shortcut to get to the contact page, were his image, profile and practice's address are displayed. 



## Page main image


The main image is present on the Home, About and Sessions pages. It's function is to grab the user's attention and to enhance the groups' ethos and practices. The text overlay provides information about activity and ethos and another overlay displays an inspirational quote.

## Page information section


On the Home, About and Sessions pages, the information section is divided into a text and image area. The images enhance the content. Titles are displayed as headings.

## Testimonials section

The testimonials on the Home page feature responses from existing users. For a more real experience, photos are displayed.

## Group leaders section

This section on the About page features the group leaders with a short description and a photograph.
For a more real experience, photos are displayed.

## Video 

The video on the Sessions page features an actual session.

## Slidehow image gallery

This feature is on the Gallery page. It displays one image at the time, with side buttons. The images are the size of the main images on the Home, About and Gallery pages in order to stay in keeping with the site's general layout. A slow zoomout enhances the images, and there is a friendly message to the user in the bottom right corner in a text overlay. There is also a heading on the page, which gives the main message of the page.


## Contact details section

This section on the Contact page provides email-address, phone number, web address, venue address.

## Child psychologist section

On the contact page, a child psychologist's image, profile and practice's address are displayed. Users can also get here by clicking on the Contact a child psychologist link in the footer.

## Contact form

This section on the Contact page features a contact form where users can input their name and email address and then submit those to the site owners. 

## Radio buttons

On the Contact page, the user can let the site owners know whether he/she wants to participate in the sessions soon. Radio buttons are technically part of the contact form.

## Map

On the Contact page, the embedded Google map will help the user find the venue.

## Confidentiality document page 

This page opens from the footer Confidentiality link. It features a padlock icon to enhance the content, the actual statement and a back arrow icon and a link to get back on the Home page. It's styled the same colour as the main page background.

## Future features

# Structure
## Wireframes


### Wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop view are available here: 

[Mobile View](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/wireframes/Milestone_Project_1_Wireframes%20for%20mobile%20view.pdf)


[Tablet View](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/wireframes/Milestone_Project_1_Wireframes%20for%20tablet%20view.pdf)


[Desktop View](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/wireframes/Milestone_Project_1_Wireframes%20for%20desktop%20view.pdf)

## Discrepancies with original ideas


*  Overall 

Overall I kept to the basic layout described in the wireframes. The main discrepancy  is that I didn't implement a hamburger menu in mobile
view as planned. Also, in tablet and mobile view, the copyright message is not displayed. See Issues for explanation.

* On individual pages
  * Home page

  I added more text start with, as I felt the user would look for information on the group. I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. The testimonials are displayed in a 2-by-2 view, instead of a 4-by-1 and used images, too to introduce the reviewers. I used Welcome instead of Intro.

    *  About page


    I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. I used Our Group Leaders instead of History and used images, too to introduce them. I also planned to put the child psychologist contact details and image here, which are on the Contact page right now. I felt this was more logical and coherent.

    *  Sessions page 

    I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. Also, a video is featured here, that I wanted to display in the Gallery page, as one of the images.

    *  Gallery page


    Instead of a mosaic image layout I displayed a whole page slideshow gallery. I felt this is more consistent with the layout of the previous pages that display a large size main image on top.

    *  Contact page 


    I changed the arrangements of the 3 sections on the page. The two 50% size sections are displayed in reverse order as the user will look for the contact details first according to the page title and on smaller screens the contact details might not show without scrolling down first. Also I inserted the child psychologist's details here. 


    The contact form is for newsletter subscription purposes, as opposed to the original where it was meant for contacting the site. This would have merely duplicated the contact option, without any added function.


    The radio button question has been changed to asking the user whether they would want to join soon. The original question would have been answered by the user in the process of contacting the group anyway.

    *  Confidentiality page - was meant to be the way it is in the final version. 

    ## Colours

    For the colours I partly used the [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/) site and the in-built colour palette in Gitpod. I aimed for low-tone, relaxing colours that harmonize with each other, as users turn to the site in distress, seeking for comfort. Dominant colours are shades of blue, shades  taupe, white, light blue-green and grey and black for text. Main images were selected accordingly.

    [Example for colour implementation - About page](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/About_page_main_image.JPG)

    ## Typography


    For the main text flow I used 'Lora', serif from Google fonts as it has nicely formed letters with a flow effect and it has a default font-weight that didn't need extra Css styling. 

    For links in the header and navbar and text-overlays displaying mottos and extra information, also image gallery overlay I used default 'Rubik', sans-serif from Google Fonts, sans-serif, as I find it matter-of fact letter-type. 

    For page headings I used the default 'Open Sans', sans-serif from Google Fonts, sans-serif, as I find it matter-of fact letter-type but it also differs from Rubik.


# Technologies

### The following technologies and platforms were used to create the site:

*  **HTML** for structure and text

*  **CSS** for styling

* **Javascript** for the Gallery page slideshow gallery

* **Google Fonts** for text

* **Font Awesome for icons** for icons

* **Responsivity mockup sites** to test responsivity

* **Gitpod** to create pages and assets

* **Github** to store created pages and assets


# Testing 

 ## Validation 

   My Home, About, Sessions, Gallery, Contact, Confidentiality html pages passed in the W3C HTML Validator with the following result. I needed to fix minor errors on 3 pages before: **Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.**

   My CSS page passed in the W3C Jigsaw CSS validator with the following result: **CSS Congratulations! No Error Found.**

  There were 9 warning messages displayed regarding imported elements. 
  These relate to the imported stylesheet on top of the page and the elements are imported to power the text overlay transform features.

  [CSS Warning messages after successful validation](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/CSS%20warning%20messages%20in%20Jigsaw.JPG)

  ## Testing in supported browsers

  I used the following most up-to-date browsers:

  * Google Chrome
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Microsoft Edge
  * Internet Explorer

  Chrome, Firefox and Edge displayed the site without problems. Firefox and Edge display a sligthly different background color. 
  My guess is, they don't feature the colours I imported from the ColorSpace website and they substitute it with the closest match.

  Internet Explorer didn't display the animated features including the Javascript powered slideshow Gallery  first. 
  After I moved the javascript source links form the head into the end of the body page, these features worked as well.

  ## Responsiveness

  I checked the responsiveness on the following tools while creating the pages:

  * Google Developer Tools

  * Am I Responsive website

  The finished product was tested on the following devices:

  * Samsung Galaxy A51
  * Ipad
  * Huawei P30 Pro
  * Samsung Galaxy S5

  The site looked the way it was intended on almost all devices. However, the Ipad does not display the main images.
   Apparently that could do with the IOS system or Safari, I couldn't resolve this issue, however, in Google Developer 
   tools everything looks as meant.

  I also found while testing the responsive layout in Google Developer tools, that the smaller the device screen size, the better the header looks.

  ## Features 

  All features are working as intended. Contact form asks for relevant information if not given. 
  Radio buttons allow user to select one option at the time.

## Bugs, Issues


* Hamburger menu

I tried to insert a hamburger menu for mobile view using Javascript following the [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp) link,
 however, the opened link tabs stayed open after being clicked on, and occupied too much space on the screen, so I reverted to using the header links. 

* Gap on the side of main images in large desktop view

This is due to the actual width of the images, which is 1500px and the screen width is wider than that. 
I considered resizing the images but I found that it affects the image quality, 
so I left it the way it is.  

* Header occupied a large portion of the screen in mobile view

 In mobile view the header took up too much space and nav elements appeared partly under each other. I resized the header in all views. In mobile views I reduced the line height, font size, the logo and all paddings and margins that could be done without. I gave the navbar a width of 90% and the logo 10%. This doesn't apply to devices under the screen width of under 321 px. Here I simply floated the logo to the left and reduced the navbar elements. On larger mobile devices the logo and the nav elements appear on 2 different lines, however the nav items are pretty much centered and the layout has improved a lot. 


* Extra space between elements Contact child psychologist link and copyright statement on About and Sessions pages. On the About page the footer was inside the #hero-text-area section, taking it out fixed the issue. 


* On the Sessions page an extra margin of 10px was was applied to the h3 footer elements, and extra 10px padding was applied to the footer h6 elements. Styling just the footer h3 elements by stopping them from sharing the same properties as the navbar elements and footer links was half of the solution. In the properties I set both margin and padding to 0. I created an id for the footer h6 and styled this again with no margin or padding.

[Gap as intended](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/gap%20between%20contact%20child%20psychologist%20link%20and%20copyright%20as%20intended.JPG)
[Gap appears larger than intended](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/gap%20appear%20larger%20on%20Sessions%20and%20Gallery%20pages.JPG)


* The above helped me solve another issue where creating an extra div for the copyright statement and placing it after the Follow us on social media text in the html file highlighted the flaws mentioned in the above section. The copyright statement had to be part of the of footer-item-center div, after the Contact a child psychologist link. Therefore, when diaplayed in mobile view, the copyright statement was displayed between links and not at the bottom. Therefore, in tablet and mobile view the copyright needed to hidden in the @media queries. 

[Illogical position of copyright statement in the footer in tablet and mobile view](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/footer%20and%20copyright.JPG)



* Radio buttons allow user to select two options at the same time. 

This was solved by adding a name to the radio input tags. 
[Radio button allows to selections at the same time](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/Radio%20buttons.JPG)

* Gap between main Home image and text area

A gap appeared between the main image and the text area in tablet and large desktop view. This was due to the narrower height and width of the image from the rest.
 I fixed this issue resizing the image for the 2 extra views. However, when tested on my Android Galaxy A51, the gap appeared there (not before). I fixed this by adding an extra 20px of height and line height in mobile view. This fixed the issue.
